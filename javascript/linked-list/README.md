# Linked List Whiteboard Solution
# Linked List Challenge

This repository contains the implementation of a Linked List data structure. The Linked List class provides methods to insert nodes, search for values, and retrieve a string representation of the list.

## Task

The task was to implement the following features in the `LinkedList` class:

- Create a Node class with properties for the value stored in the Node and a pointer to the next Node.
- Create a Linked List class with a head property.
- Implement the following methods in the Linked List class:
  - `insert`: Adds a new node with the given value to the head of the list with O(1) time performance.
  - `includes`: Indicates whether a value exists as a node's value somewhere within the list.
  - `toString`: Returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL".

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested using unit tests. The test suite includes the following test cases:

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property properly points to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Returns true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Returns false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
